\section*{New Course Structure}
Due to the precautions taken by Texas A\&M University to slow the spread of COVID-19, AGEC 317 is moving to an online structure. We will no longer meet in-person, which affects how the class is going to be structured. Instead of traditional lectures, we will be using a combination of instructional videos and smaller group sessions on Zoom. If you haven't already, you should \href{https://tamu.zoom.us}{download Zoom here}. So how is this going to work?

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{BEFORE} each virtual class period, you must watch the lecture video. These videos will be shorter than 20 minutes, but will contain all the essential information for that lecture. During the virtual class section, we will work through an example, so it is very important that you watch the lecture video before we begin.
	\item \textbf{DURING} our normal class period, we will split up into three groups. I will notify you of your group number. You will log onto Zoom only during your group's session time, and we will work through an example together in 15 minutes. At the end of each class period, there is an open session where anyone can log on to ask additional questions.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Course YouTube Channel}
I will be posting video links on eCampus, but you can access the YouTube videos directly from \href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxDNlrqcNZ4c3yS8IN_aC7A/featured}{here}.

\section*{Course Website}
All information is still on \href{http://ecampus.tamu.edu}{eCampus.}

\section*{Group Numbers}
You are split into groups based on your last name:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{A-G}: Group 1
	\item \textbf{H-P}: Group 2
	\item \textbf{R-Z}: Group 3
\end{itemize}

\section*{Office Hours}
Office hours will now be held virtually over Zoom, but will still be one-on-one sessions. I will send out a survey at the beginning of each week, where you can reserve a 15-minute slot during my normally scheduled office hours.

\section*{Zoom Etiquette}
When you log onto Zoom for a class session, please be sure to \textbf{mute your microphone and turn off your camera}. I will be screen-sharing, so none of us need to see each other, and if everyone is muted we can focus on the exercise. If you want to ask a question, unmute yourself, interrupt me, and then re-mute yourself after your question. 


{\Huge Other than above, the class will remain unchanged}

\section*{Special note}
This special circumstance is a big inconvenience to us all, and the University has assumed that you have access to strong, reliable internet. If you don't, please let me know and we can discuss how to work around your unique circumstances.
