\begin{frame}{Course expectations}
There are no dedicated help sessions for Excel; you are responsible for practicing and becoming familiar with the software. We will cover any functions you may use on problem sets in lectures, so \textbf{come to class}. You are encouraged to have your laptop out and follow along in Excel. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Course expectations}
This is a math course. There are no math geniuses. No one is inherently bad at math. Your success in this class (and in your future career) is about \emph{effort}, not what you know. Try hard, and you'll be happily surprised at how much you can do at the end of this course.
