### Bonus Materials
After moving to an online format with the advent of COVID-19, my lectures moved from the classroom to YouTube! You can watch lecture videos for modules 6 - 8 on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxDNlrqcNZ4c3yS8IN_aC7A).

For those interested in using R, see my [tutorial for beginners](https://michael-black.github.io/pages/R-for-Regression). The tutorial should give you the skills to replicate any of the problem sets in R. If you want to check your answers or troubleshoot, don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:black.michael@tamu.edu).
