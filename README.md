### UPDATE
Texas A\&M University has moved to online instruction due to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. See the original syllabus for the traditional course structure. The new syllabus has also been added to reflect the new course structure in an online format. You can watch Lecture videos for modules 6 - 8 on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxDNlrqcNZ4c3yS8IN_aC7A).
